## CIS18B-S25-33479 Assignment 4

### Overview
This repository contains Java source code for Assignment 4 of the CIS18B (Spring 2025) course. The project demonstrates various object-oriented programming principles, including:
- **Iterator Pattern** (GenreIterator lets clients traverse only the available books of a chosen genre without exposing the underlying List)
- **Custom Exceptions** (BookNotAvailableException and BookNotFoundException provide descriptive error handling instead of generic exceptions)

The project models a simple library where a user can:
- search for books by title or genre
- check out available books
- return previously checked‑out books

### Running the Project
After cloning the repository, navigate to the `src` directory:

```bash
cd CIS18B-S25-33479-Assignment4/src
```

All main project files are located in this directory.

To compile and run the code from the terminal, use the following commands:

```bash
javac LibraryTest.java
java LibraryTest
```

### Important Notes

- Ensure you are in the `src` directory when compiling and running the Java files.

### Project Structure
```
src/
│
├── Book.java                     // Domain model representing a book
├── BookIterator.java             // Iterator interface for book collections
├── BookNotAvailableException.java
├── BookNotFoundException.java
├── GenreIterator.java            // Concrete iterator filtering by genre & availability
├── LibraryCollection.java        // Aggregates books and coordinates operations
├── LibrarySeed.java              // Generates sample data for demo purposes
├── LibraryTest.java              // ***Main*** entry point (console UI)
└── LibraryUser.java              // Represents a single library patron

```

### Main Execution
The entry point of the application is the LibraryTest.java file.

### Expected Behavior
- **Account Creation**: Prompts for account username.
- **Menu**:
  - ***Search by Title***: Prompts to search library map of books for a given title.
  - ***Search by Genre***: Prompts to search library for books in a given genre.
  - ***Return Book by Title***: Prompts which book a user should return
  - ***Exit***: Terminates the application.
